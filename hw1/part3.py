AA 276 Homework 1 | Coding Portion | Part 3 of 3


OVERVIEW

In this file, you will implement functions for 
visualizing your learned CBF from Part 1 and evaluating
the accuracy of the learned CBF and corresponding CBF-QP controller.


INSTRUCTIONS

Make sure you pass the tests for Part 1 and Part 2 before you begin.
Please refer to the Homework 1 handout for instructions and implementation details.

Function headers are provided below.
Your code should go into the sections marked by "YOUR CODE HERE"

When you are done, make sure that (in your VM) there is a CBF model checkpoint
saved at `outputs/cbf.ckpt`. Then, run `python scripts/plot.py`.
Submit the false safety rate reported in the terminal and the plot that is
saved to `outputs/plot.png`.

REMEMBER TO SHUTDOWN YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINES AFTER TRAINING, TO AVOID ACCUMULATING FEES.
